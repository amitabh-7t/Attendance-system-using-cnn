## 📌 Project Title
**AI Attendance System**

## 📝 Description

The AI Attendance System is a modern, full-stack web application designed to streamline student attendance management for educational institutions. Built using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, it provides a sleek, responsive dashboard for managing subjects, datasets, students, and attendance records.

This system solves the inefficiency and manual workload of traditional attendance tracking methods by offering digital record management, simplified uploads, and structured subject monitoring in one platform.
